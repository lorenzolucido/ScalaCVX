# ScalaCVX [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lorenzolucido/ScalaCVX.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lorenzolucido/ScalaCVX)

##### Version: 0.0.1
An implementation of CVX (Convex Optimization) framework in Scala programming language.

The project is in early development stage.

The objective is to bring to Scala a native **Disciplined Convex Programming** (DCP) framework for convex optimization problems.
Currently, such frameworks exist already for:

 - [Matlab](http://cvxr.com),
 - [Python](http://cvxpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html)
 - [Julia](http://convexjl.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

They are a great source of inspiration for this project,
together with [Stephen Boyd's famous webpage](http://stanford.edu/~boyd/index.html).
